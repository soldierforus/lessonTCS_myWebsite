        <p>
            My name is Travis Bennett, and this is my personal website.  Some things I want to accomplish in coding are:
            <ul>
                <li id = "l1">
                    To make a game
                </li>
                <li id = "l2">
                    To make software that helps people
                </li>
                <li id = "l3">
                    To be continously learning new programming languages
                </li>
            </ul>
